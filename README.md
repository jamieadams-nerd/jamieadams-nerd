## About Me
I am a principal software engineer with more than thirty years of experience building and supporting secure Linux systems, cross-domain solutions (CDS), multilevel security (MLS) platforms, and high-assurance auditing subsystems. My work has spanned system administration, C development, Python GTK tooling, SNMPv3 integrations, secure logging architectures, FIPS-compliant cryptography, and hardened Red Hat environments.

For nearly two decades I contributed to accredited CDS and MLS products, including:
	•	Forensic-quality audit/event subsystems aligned with RTB requirements
	•	Remote guard monitoring with MLS-enforced separation
	•	CDS-MIB and SNMPv3 notification integrations
	•	Protocol adapters enabling safe SMTP and printing across security boundaries
	•	High-assurance secure coding, formal testing, and FIPS-aligned architecture reviews

## Work Philosophy
I value clarity, correctness, simplicity, and security. Code should be readable, predictable, and maintainable under pressure. System administrators should never have to guess what a tool is doing. Effective secure engineering is a mix of discipline, respect for constraints, and clean design.

Gandalf the Green / High Herbalist
Outside of formal engineering, I maintain a wizard-themed identity called “Gandalf the Green,” inspired by my High Herbalist persona, Thistledown Greenleaf. For me, good engineering feels like careful spellcraft — understanding deep rules, writing precise incantations (code), and making complexity understandable through discipline and craft.

Repositories You’ll Find Here
	•	Rust command-line tools (classical ciphers, secure coding demonstrations)
	•	Python GTK3 utilities for secure administration and cryptographic verification
	•	Secure logging and auditing subsystem demonstrations
	•	Linux MLS/SELinux educational examples
	•	Documentation templates and technical essays
	•	Wizard-themed branding artifacts for fun and teaching

Disclaimers
All public repositories are for educational, illustrative, and experimental purposes only.
They are not turnkey solutions for accredited MLS/CDS systems.
Cryptographic examples may not be FIPS validated.
Always conduct independent security review and accreditation processes before using any code operationally.
