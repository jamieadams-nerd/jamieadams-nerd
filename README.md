## About Me
I am a principal software engineer with more than thirty years of experience building and supporting secure Linux systems, cross-domain solutions (CDS), multilevel security (MLS) platforms, and high-assurance auditing subsystems. My work has spanned system administration, C development, Python GTK tooling, SNMPv3 integrations, secure logging architectures, FIPS-compliant cryptography, and hardened Red Hat environments.

For nearly two decades I contributed to accredited CDS and MLS products, including:
* Forensic-quality audit/event subsystems aligned with RTB requirements
* Remote guard monitoring with MLS-enforced separation
* CDS-MIB and SNMPv3 notification integrations
* Protocol adapters enabling safe SMTP and printing across security boundaries
* High-assurance secure coding, formal testing, and FIPS-aligned architecture reviews

## Work Philosophy
I value clarity, correctness, simplicity, and security. Code should be readable, predictable, and maintainable under pressure. System administrators should never have to guess what a tool is doing. Effective secure engineering is a mix of discipline, respect for constraints, and clean design.


### Repositories You’ll Find Here

## Disclaimers
All public repositories are provided solely for educational, illustrative, and experimental use. They are not turnkey or accredited MLS/CDS solutions, and any cryptographic examples may lack FIPS validation. Independent security review and accreditation must be performed before using any code operationally.

All content is derived exclusively from publicly available cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and open-source documentation, with links provided where applicable. No sensitive, classified, or system-specific configurations appear in any material; all examples are generic and instructional. Recommendations and best practices reflect over 30 years of professional experience in secure systems and are aligned with public standards while remaining entirely independent of any real-world system configuration.
