## About Me
I am a principal software engineer with more than thirty years of experience building and supporting secure Linux systems, cross-domain solutions (CDS), multilevel security (MLS) platforms, and high-assurance auditing subsystems. My work has spanned system administration, C development, Python GTK tooling, SNMPv3 integrations, secure logging architectures, FIPS-compliant cryptography, and hardened Red Hat environments.

For nearly two decades I contributed to accredited CDS and MLS products, including:
	•	Forensic-quality audit/event subsystems aligned with RTB requirements
	•	Remote guard monitoring with MLS-enforced separation
	•	CDS-MIB and SNMPv3 notification integrations
	•	Protocol adapters enabling safe SMTP and printing across security boundaries
	•	High-assurance secure coding, formal testing, and FIPS-aligned architecture reviews

## Work Philosophy
I value clarity, correctness, simplicity, and security. Code should be readable, predictable, and maintainable under pressure. System administrators should never have to guess what a tool is doing. Effective secure engineering is a mix of discipline, respect for constraints, and clean design.


### Repositories You’ll Find Here
	•	Rust command-line tools (classical ciphers, secure coding demonstrations)
	•	Python GTK3 utilities for secure administration and cryptographic verification
	•	Secure logging and auditing subsystem demonstrations
	•	Linux MLS/SELinux educational examples
	•	Documentation templates and technical essays
	•	Wizard-themed branding artifacts for fun and teaching

## Disclaimers
All public repositories are for educational, illustrative, and experimental purposes only.
They are not turnkey solutions for accredited MLS/CDS systems.
Cryptographic examples may not be FIPS validated.
Always conduct independent security review and accreditation processes before using any code operationally.

All information on this site is based solely on publicly available cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and open-source documentation, and links to these public documents will be provided. No sensitive, classified, or system-specific configurations are used. All examples are generic demonstrations created for instructional purposes. Drawing on more than 30 years of professional experience in secure systems, I offer additional recommendations and best practices that align with these public standards while remaining entirely independent of any real-world system configuration.
